First, I had no idea what semantic was, what npm was, and I still don't understand the inner workings. 
However, I got express installed into our project
I typed while in the dwired directory
npm init 
enter a bunch of times.
npm install express --save
npm install express.
After this, I jacked simple express code for a basic server from the interwebs, and realized there was no css or js working.

luckily, chris fixed that by putting all of the files besides node modules and server.js and package.json in the public folder.
